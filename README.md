## Overview

Chips-n-Salsa is a Java library of customizable, hybridizable, iterative, 
parallel, stochastic, and self-adaptive local search algorithms. The 
library includes implementations of several stochastic local search algorithms, 
including simulated annealing, hill climbers, as well as constructive search 
algorithms such as stochastic sampling. The library most extensively supports 
simulated annealing. It includes several classes for representing solutions 
to a variety of optimization problems. For example, the library includes a 
BitVector class that implements vectors of bits, as well as classes for 
representing solutions to problems where we are searching for an optimal 
vector of integers or reals. For each of the built-in representations, the 
library provides the most common mutation operators for generating random 
neighbors of candidate solutions. Additionally, the library provides 
extensive support for permutation optimization problems, including 
implementations of many different mutation operators for permutations, and 
utilizing the efficiently implemented Permutation class of the 
[JavaPermutationTools (JPT)](https://jpt.cicirello.org/) library.

Chips-n-Salsa is customizable, making extensive use of Java's generic types, 
enabling using the library to optimize other types of representations beyond 
what is provided in the library. It is hybridizable, providing support for 
integrating multiple forms of local search (e.g., using a hill climber on a 
solution generated by simulated annealing), creating hybrid mutation operators 
(e.g., local search using multiple mutation operators), as well as support 
for running more than one type of search for the same problem concurrently 
using multiple threads as a form of algorithm portfolio. Chips-n-Salsa is 
iterative, with support for multistart metaheuristics, including implementations 
of several restart schedules for varying the run lengths across the restarts. 
It also supports parallel execution of multiple instances of the same, or 
different, stochastic local search algorithms for an instance of a problem 
to accelerate the search process. The library supports self-adaptive search 
in a variety of ways, such as including implementations of adaptive annealing 
schedules for simulated annealing, such as the Modified Lam schedule, 
implementations of the simpler annealing schedules but which self-tune the 
initial temperature and other parameters, and restart schedules that 
adapt to run length.

## Repository Organization

The GitHub repository is organized as follows:
* The /build directory contains an ant build file, and other resources 
related to building the library.
* The /dist directory contains the compiled jar files of the library, 
one consisting of just the Chips-n-Salsa library, and a second jar file
that contains Chips-n-Salsa as well as all dependencies.  The file name makes
it clear which is which.
* The /docs directory contains the javadoc documentation in a sub-directory /docs/api.
The /docs directory is also the location of the website for the project hosted via
GitHub pages.
* The /examples directory contains several example programs that use the library,
and which demonstrate usage of various features.
* The /lib directory contains jar files of all dependencies.  At the present time, 
the only dependency is a library [JavaPermutationTools (JPT)](https://jpt.cicirello.org/)
which is used for its representation of a Permutation, as well as for some of
its random number generation capabilities.
* The /src directory contains all of the source code for Chips-n-Salsa.
* The /tests directory contains JUnit test cases for all functionality of the library.
