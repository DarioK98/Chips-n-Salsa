/**
 * <p>This class implements a window-limited version of the 
 * {@link InsertionMutation} mutation operator on permutations.  A window-limited
 * mutation operator on permutations is a mutation operator such that there is a window 
 * constraint, w, on the random indexes used by the mutation.  For a mutation operator
 * that uses a pair of random indexes, (i, j), these indexes are constrained such that |i-j| &le; w.
 * All index pairs that satisfy the window constraint are equally likely.</p>
 * <p>The runtime (worst case and average case) of both
 * the {@link #mutate(Permutation) mutate} and {@link #undo(Permutation) undo} methods is O(min(n,w)),
 * where n is the length of the permutation.  Since chosen indexes can be no more than w positions apart,
 * at most (w+1) elements are moved.</p>
 *
