<h3>About the Chips-n-Salsa Library</h3>
<p>Chips-n-Salsa is a Java library of Customizable, Hybridizable, 
Iterative, Parallel, Stochastic, and Self-Adaptive Local Search Algorithms.
The Chips-n-Salsa library includes implementations of several stochastic
local search algorithms, including simulated annealing, hill climbers,
as well as constructive search algorithms such as stochastic sampling.
The library most extensively supports simulated annealing.
The library includes several built-in representations for representing
solutions to a variety of optimization problems.  For example, the library
includes a BitVector class that implements vectors of bits, as well as classes
for representing solutions to problems where we are searching for an optimal
vector of integers or reals.  For each of the built-in representations, the
library provides the most common mutation operators for generating random
neighbors of candidate solutions.  Additionally, the library provides
extensive support for permutation optimization problems, including implementations
of a very large variety of mutation operators for permutations, and utilizing the efficiently
implemented Permutation class of 
the <a href="https://jpt.cicirello.org/">JavaPermutationTools (JPT)</a> library.</p>
<p>Chips-n-Salsa is customizable in that it makes extensive use of generic types,
enabling using the library to optimize other types of representations beyond what
is provided in the library.  It is hybridizable, providing support for integrating
multiple forms of local search (e.g., using a hill climber on a solution generated by
simulated annealing), creating hybrid mutation operators (e.g., local search using 
multiple mutation operators), and classes that support running more than one type
of search for the same problem concurrently using multiple threads as a form of
algorithm portfolio.  Chips-n-Salsa is iterative, with support for multistart 
metaheuristics, including implementations of several restart schedules for
varying the run lengths across the restarts.  It also supports parallel execution
of multiple instances of the same, or different, stochastic local search algorithms
for an instance of a problem to accelerate the search process.  The library supports
self-adaptive search in a variety of ways, such as including implementations of
adaptive annealing schedules for simulated annealing, such as the Modified Lam schedule,
implementations of the simpler annealing schedules but which self-tune the initial temperature
and other parameters, and restart schedules that adapt run length.</p>
